This is where squash shines.\nNormally you do not develop a single thing long. There are exceptions though. Again rebase shines and the longer you do this, the more pain it is.\nThen releasing is approaching slowly. You should understand what is an annotated tag.

Transpilation is a style of compilation that translates code from one language into another. In typescript that's theoretically really simple because it is a superset of JavaScript. Presumably if you remove all type information from the typescript file, it could be run like a normal JavaScript file. This is not exactly the case, but you get the difference with a language like C that gets compiled into machine code.

JS wise there is nothing special to it. I assume the b is as defined in the previous code block.

What you describe in the problem is not a module problem, but the peculiarities of server-oriented methods (SSR, SSG, etc.). I have written 100 times in articles about how a module reduces the bundle size, but I can repeat that, unlike many frameworks and libraries with a bunch of boilerplate, you put it all on the server, and on the client you have an empty framework, where the code is then loaded. Accordingly, the user will load such a framework much faster than a boilerplate from a framework, simply because the size of the final bundle will not be 200 MB, but 10 MB of empty tags with request objects.', ""I am aware of the bundle size of the SSR/SSG frameworks like Next/Nuxt etc. But your direct contenders seem to be like template engines like pug and ejs. Also, with template engines, you get SSR by default.

Here is my musing (current thinking) which I\'m looking to confirm or correct: When the promise is instantiated it passes a two default callbacks to the executor, and runs the executor immediately (on the stack). A call to the first argument will have the Promise update it\'s state from ""pending"" to ""fulfilled"" and a call to the second will have it updated to ""rejected"". When the executor is finished (returns) it should have called one of these (or the promise will never resolve). After it has finished the instantiator returns and the promise is one of its three states. A call to .then() (optional) will register one or two callback handlers (for fulfilled and rejected). If the state of the promise is currently fulfilled or rejected it will immediately queues the appropriate callback onto the microtasks queue and return. If the state is pending, then the Promise itself will, as soon as its resolver or rejecter are called queue the appropriate callback then. I\'m not sure if that\'s entirely accurate and would love to see it documented as well as you have if it is, and or what is right if it\'s not.', ""When await is used, there is a situation I'm not clear on too. Await works a bit like yield I'm told, and it seems maintains the state of the running async function (on the heap one presumes) and as you write puts the async function on the microtask queue to continue at the same line (which the preserved state enables, though said state could be on the heap or on the microtask queue who knows?). In your example the function one resolves quickly, instantly, but if the function we are waiting on is still pending when the async function reaches the head of the microtask queue and runs once more, what then? I would guess it simply requeues itself.

After I complete my goal, I take a real break where I do something that involves my other senses and relaxes my brain.

But the idea itself has definitely been floating around for the last few decades."", 'Good on \'ya for having studied the literature. Yeah I think it\'s all about incentives. The academics are in the business of cranking out papers, which boils out to justifying their next round of funding. The frameworks they do develop are just means to that end. The shear effort it takes to gain broad acceptance - which you\'ve explained well - has no payoff for them. The clinker is that many (most?) academic grants are focused on sustaining research efforts for their own sake, without paying enough attention to practical impact. They throw the community development task over the wall and hope someone else picks it up, which seldom happens. The main mechanism I see is ""doing a startup"" to hawk an academic idea as a product.

And I mention that to the 'copilot'. And what it does it makes it that the information is now retrieved from the back end every nano second or so. And this for one user. So in case of thousands of users the backend would have been overwhelmed with requests. So much for 'vibe coding'. But don't get me wrong, I think 'vibe coding' is great for prototypes and one off or great helpers in case I am stuck. But if I do not know what I am doing it is just going to generate AI slop.

This situation gave rise to the fact that developers outside large companies after a while already demanded that development be as simple as possible. The simpler the development environment was (and languages with technologies, of course), the more developers outside of large companies received large companies and, as a result, more profit (a prime example of Flash technology). New developers are already coming to development environments in which simplicity is above all and they are simply afraid to go down a level, they think that black magic is going on there, and when they encounter a problem at a lower level, they think that it is enough to go to stackoveflow or write an issue on github and there are already dark lords lower levels versed in black magic just solve the problem.

The cost, speed, and energy savings make a strong case for running models on personal hardware instead of relying on cloud-based systems.

Thank you.', '1) This ""similarity"" is asymmetric. Look at the definition of TFIDF, it calculates for whatever you consider the corpus, not the query. So when you switch query and corpus, you are changing the weights (IDF) or the ""normalization"" (I prefer to think of square-root(DF) as the denominator for both texts - the corpus as well as the query). Geometrically: You have two psuedo-vectors V1 and V2. Naively we think of similarity as some equivalent to cosine of the angle between them. But the ""angle"" is being calculated after a projection of both V1 and V2. Now if this projection is determined symmetrically you\'ll be fine. But actually the projection of both vectors is based on a component of the first vector. So it is not symmetric under exhange. Concretely, consider two vectors V1 = (3,4,5) and V2 = (3,1,2). Our rule is to calculate the angle after projecting perpendicular to the largest component of the first vector (to down weight or eliminate the most common tokens in the corpus). If V1 is the corpus, you are calculating the angle between V1\' = (3,4,0) and V2\' = (3,1,0). If V2 is the corpus you are calculating the angle between V1"" = (0,4,5) and V2"" = (0,1,2).', ""2) Again think geometrically in terms of projections. If your corpus has only one document, every token in that document has the maximum DF. So when you project perpendicular to this, you get zero! Algebraically, I suspect that what people call IDF is actually Log(IDF). So a token that appears in every document in the corpus has a DF of 1, its inverse is 1 and the log of that is ... 0. So if you only have one document, every token satisfies this and you are left with LIDF = 0.\nWhy log? probably something based on Zipf's law. But remember, this (LIDF) is not mathematically derived, it is just a heuristic that has become common usage. If you prefer, to do geometry with distributions, you should use something like the symmetrized Kullbach - Lieber probability divergence, or even better, the Euclidean metric in logit space."", 'Hi, this is very helpful!

I have often seen folks comprehend a large list into memory for a loop only to break the loop early meaning all members of the comprehended list with indices higher than the member where the list was broken were wasted CPU time and memory. I have also seen folks comprehend an original dataset into a second, separate variable (possibly for clarity's sake?) to use once and then never again but the GC never collects it because a variable still refers to it.

Afterwards, they can move to others.', ""You never really master anything in the world of programming and to say you have mastered anything is arrogant. I think you've done well with the title of the post it's very click baity. I just hope new junior developers don't think they have to learn them all as you don't and knowing one well will serve you well throughout your whole career"", 'Mastery means one should be good on that language or framework. Everyone knows that you cannot master anything being a human being. I never advised new devs to learn all of them. I re-iterate that one language should be focused. I disagree that knowing one will suffice through whole career. If you work on some fast paced environment technologies also change rapidly and you accordingly as a dev have to evolve with that.', ""While I do appreciate the benevolent intention of introducing new devs to these frameworks, the title definitely sounds like you're suggesting one to complete all five tutorials. To add value to this article, I would suggest leaving out the descriptions of all the frameworks since they all sound the same, and talk about why you're recommending these tutorials - which should be the focus of this article."", ""Yup I agree to that. As a developer you are correct, but if you think as a writer, titles have to be a bit of attractive. So, that's why I have made the title like that. Yup. Soon, I would be listing all frameworks, listing their advantages and disadvantages so that the decision is more easier for juniors to pick up the framework of their choice. Thanks for you input BTW."", 'Each solves the same problems in slightly different ways you learn more by trying out a few of them at least.', 'Some patterns are explained more clearly in the documentation of one or another framework and their popular libraries.', ""Sure master one of them, but it doesn't hurt to try out alternatives every now and then."", 'Yeah master one of them and then also taste others.

I suggest the same. Thanks for your input.', ""No. It is not. It's just to give beginners of an idea of which framework they should choose.

That's EXACTLY why I do it. Take some time to develop a sense of empathy. THAT will make you a better developer!"", 'I think yes concepts should be focused on. Afterwards, if you reach mid-level of your career, then you need to know at least basics of other frameworks.', ""I don't think backend is 80% of the effort. I think it's the opposite: front-end apps (spa) take most of the work and logic of an application, the backend just serves authentication, authorization and get and saves data."", ""Yeah you are correct if we think in the server-side which is older concept and pic in the article also reflects that. If you think in terms of modern web apps, I will say it's 50/50 now. Backend also has many advanced things like caching, different layers, different DBs for different tasks, load balancing etc and client also has got more complex with state management, real time updates to DOM etc."", ""Think that really depends on the application. If you're working on applications that handle things like billing, email reminders, automated tasks and so on most of the logic would be in the backend."", ""I am confused in between node.js and django and Laravel.

Thanks for your comment. I think if you are good on JS, then you should pick up Node.js . Django and Laravel are good but they are a bit complicated when compared to Node.js . Then, practice on it so that you can develop a complete web app. In this way, you will feel more confident.', 'First of thank uh for your reply. Btw it means i should learn node.js right. And if i want to be full stack developer based on it,then which languages i should also learn. Or from these which should i learn first ?tell me also this.', ""Neat list. But you don't have to do everything all at once. It might do more harm than good when learning backends. Better to learn the underlying principles which stay more or less the same irrespective of language or framework."", 'Yup. I have just listed them in case any beginner wants to pursue a language then he can chose given frameworks. However, I completely agree that concepts should be focused instead of languages or frameworks.', ""Note to newbies: don't get intimidated if you don't know them all by tomorrow. Just make a start.\nNote to oldies like me: always a good idea to learn new stuff and this is a great list to start with.\nThanks Saeed."", 'It is good to know these frameworks or at least learn 2 of them.\nI work mainly with Laravel and recently getting into django and was surprised at how similar they are, also RoR. Although at the moment i am working only with PHP based frameworks, getting familiar with one or 2 will not only give you a different point of view. Also it will help you jump ship if that time comes later in your career.', 'What about C#? Surprised at the lack of mention since the title claims doing these will help you ""Master the Back-End"" - C# is the preferred language used for Windows backend development...', ""Hey Rachel. Thanks for your comment. But my article is more focused towards new trends. So, I don't think it is a good idea for a junior to learn C#, if he's starting backend nowadays."", ""If I may make a suggestion then, I'd change the title to something that indicates that it's focused on trending frameworks/stacks."", ""As for not suggesting a Junior to learn C#, why not? That's where I started about a year and a half ago and it's treated me very well so far."", ""Yeah Rachel. I think that it's great if you have enjoyed working with C#, but my personal opinion in this regard is that one should look forward to learn JS or Python. I think that JavaScript has great ecosystem and also you can move on to hybrid or cross-platform like React Native, Ionic or NativeScript. Plus for Python, I recommend it because of it's extensive usage in Data Science and ML.So, if you work on these languages there's a great chance that you would stumble upon something different which may help you in long term in your career. However, overall I think one needs to be familiar with general programming concepts and once you are done with that you can harness the power of any programming language to solve problems. Yeah exactly, it's more about trending frameworks.""]"

NEVER use their product EVER, LOL I\'ve dubbed them RCF (""Redis a Corrupted FOSS"")\nAnd as Matéush has stated, the likes of DMOC systems are sometimes required. So pick Valkey from the Linux Foundation instead.', 'May things go well with your Sliplane project, though.', 'Yeah, valkey looks like a really good alternative at this point. Many are still somewhat locked in to redis though! Thank you:)', 'It seems like that indeed. Not surprising, as Redis has only recently ""yanked the rug out"". There are a few very interesting twists I discovered in the DMOC arena though.\nFrom MS there\'s Garnet which seems like a ""Monsta-gem, chased by a Dragonfly""...', 'MS\' Garnet is MIT licenced vs BSL for DragonflyDB. Both claim they can be used as drop-in replacements for Redis, (memcacheD in DF\'s case too) and both point out that Redis is basically ""frozen in amber"" while they are on the move in an F22 Raptor.', 'Garnet is a new remote cache-store from Microsoft Research, that is designed to be extremely fast, extensible, and low latency. Garnet is thread-scalable within a single node. It also supports sharded cluster execution, with replication, checkpointing, failover, and transactions. It can operate over main memory as well as tiered storage (such as SSD and Azure Storage)', 'Dragonfly delivers 25x the performance of legacy software', 'The power of modern cloud hardware can never be realized with legacy software. Dragonfly is optimized for modern cloud computing, delivering 25x more throughput and 12x lower snapshotting latency when compared to legacy in-memory data stores like Redis, making it easy to deliver the real-time experience your customers expect.', 'Their page title claims to be the fastest in-memory datastore, but they are not comparing themselves very overtly on their own site with Garnet like they do with many others, though. Wonder why?', 'MS does and even though Garnet appears to outperform DF, one needs to question the objectivity involved I guess. Regardless, both seem like products in for the long-game, and things can get exciting for caching in general.', 'Now us small-folk need an elegant, tiny, wasp we can employ as a lightweight, easily-configurable ""module"" or ""plug-in"" to manage client-side, hybrid and server-side API caching. Something light and framework-agnostic. Like you mentioned in your ""Don\'t Use Redis"" section, not every dev-case needs the big guys to keep the house in order.', 'Any pointers, perhaps?', ""Don't use Redis isn't always an option. Whenever you use serverless (such as Edge function or lambda) the only way to cache data is to use external memory database."", 'Good luck with Sliplane!', 'PS. I read your article live on my YouTube channel - youtu.be/L1-agUf4raE', 'Yes, especially with serverless this might not be an option! Nice video :)']"

I'm beginning to explore micro-frontends and this really helped a lot. From my experience as an enterprise architect, I would say, 1. Having a core team for the host is a must like you said. 2. I really don't think having multiple frameworks will ever work, it's just too much complexity for data sharing, performance etc. I believe you will lose all the time saved doing micro frontends by fixing those bugs!! I'd rather stick to a single framework..:)"", 'Thank you! and ....Exactly!!! Which then makes you really wonder if you truly need microfrontends in the first place :D', ""I strongly agree. If you're going to use the same framework, a well-structured monorepo will help you a lot more. It should allow teams to work in isolation, only test, build, and deploy according to what has changed in their commits. It should guard them from making deep imports."", 'The only real use case for most organizations in my mind is if feature modules are not known at build time. JavaScript itself is very dynamic and even allows arbitrary dynamics imports. Out build tools and compilers are the issue here. Recently, a build tool provided a solution for a problem it introduced itself. Webpack Module Federation. This is just scratching the surface. Microfrontends bring a lot of complexity and challenges as mentioned in this insightful article.', '100% agreed, Lars.

I have already read in 6 months, all literature about Micro Frontends out there. As I mention several times through the post, micro frontends are a good solution for products.

One thing I am expecting from micro-frontends (that we are going to use a lot more this year) is making our team a bit more scalable. As you mentioned in your article, with big FE monolith, it's not always easy for a new joiner to be quickly productive as he needs to understand how the whole application is working, and by the time the workload has decreased, he might not even have the time to become very productive. With micro-frontends (and micro-services too), hopefully with can easily and quickly integrate new joiners during high workload.

I'm currently exploring to use micro-frontends at work as well. My main reason for choosing micro-frontends is actually to be able to use different frameworks simultaneously. Our main framework will be react, but I want the possibility to migrate away from it step by step, without having to re-write the whole application from scratch. Our current monolithic frontend is written in AngularJS and since we are still a very small team, with a huge application, migrating away from AngularJS for us currently would mean no new feature releases in the current frontend, while rewriting everything in the new framework. And we don't want that to happen to us again in the future, so that if for some reason react would be deprecated, we can update each micro-frontend on it's own. That is actually an approach I want to try now with our current monolith. My current plan is to integrate the AngularJS monolith into the micro-frontend architecture and then gradually replace different parts of the application.

We all should strive for performant apps, but at some point there are diminishing returns and it's our job to figure out when it's necessary and when it's not."", 'Also, this might not even be necessary at all now with the new React Compiler.

I prefer to memoize hooks' returns values (like libraries do) from experience and given my situation, but obviously, everyone is free to memoize or not ;)"", '#66 ids — Oh sorry, I missed that.

Plus, now the value contained in fetchDataRef is not calculated at render, but at the useEffect phase so you added an asynchronous step to the state of your component.', ""You don't need the ref or the useEffect steps at all. The dependency array was enough to adjust the value without any extra step. As a bonus, the value is calculated at render and in a synchronous way."", ""Furthermore, the code is much simpler this way. You don't have to keep all these extra steps in your memory to understand how it works. The cognitive load is lower, and this makes it easier for people to understand the code."", '🚨 When you want to memoize a value, you need to do it when you define the variable that holds the value.', ""Given that fetchData is defined outside the hook, as it's passed by the consumer, memoizing it here doesn't have an impact on re-renders in the consumer."", ""If fetchData is defined in the consumer and you didn't memoize it at creation time, then it will be recalculated on every render of the consumer. What was the point in synchronizing the new function reference in useLoadData if you could have simply used the new function to begin with?"", 'If fetchData came from the parent of the consumer, then any state change in the parent would re-render the consumer (because the consumer is a children of the parent).', ""Your memoization in the consumer itself didn't prevent a re-render of the consumer at all in this case. Again, what was the point in using all that extra code if it's going to be re-calculated anyway?"", 'I would even ask what was the point of useMemo in useLoadData?', ""You need to execute the whole hook to know if 2 references have changed. If they did change, you are returning the 2 new references. If they didn't change, you are returning the 2 old references. In both case, you return 2 references, all the calculations have been done already and you memoized the tiniest and fastest possible data ever, so what did you save by adding so much code around it?"", ""Don't get me wrong, I think your whole article is amazing. I'm simply pointing out that you might need to revisit the memoization concepts because there's a tiny gap there. And I cannot stress enough that you get it better than 99.99% of developers, even if you have a tiny gap missing."", ""This is also why most of the time it's better not to use memoization at all. It's a very easy concept to grasp, but it's a very hard one to apply correctly. And mistakes in applying it are worse than not applying it at all."", ""So, I still think there is a misunderstanding here. I am using a ref here instead of useCallback dependencies because I explicitly don't want my callback to change, which will be the case if I use a dependencies array (all items will need to be memoized)."", 'Here, what I like in this pattern is that the entire complexity lives in this single hook.', 'Check similar implementations like in here or here for example.', ""I understand what you want to achieve, and I agree to a certain degree. If the hook didn't receive a parameter that is NOT memoized, I would be 100% behind the principle."", ""The flaw I'm pointing at is that the hook is getting a parameter that is not memoized. In turn, this has a few adverse effects..."", ""One of them is that it's most likely slower to run the useEffect to synchronise the fetchDataRef than actually redeclaring the loadData function every render. Memoizing is supposed to be used for expansive compute, this is just a function declaration so there's no expansive compute."", 'Another adverse effect is you have complexified your code a lot. Developers now have to take into account the useCallback implications AND the useEffect synching. Your code would most likely be just as fast without any memoization at all and would be much simpler. The ""bad"" example is actually good because you didn\'t mesure what you saved; you did premature optimization without an ounce of evidence.', ""The worse adverse effect is the bug probability part. When reading a useCallback with an empty dependency array, most will take for granted that nothing can change the function. But this is not true because you can change the fetchData function and fetch something completely different between 2 calls. Making a wrong assumption here can lead to many bugs down the line. Your good intention is opening the door for many possible problems because you didn't use the standard dependency array. You can't expect developers to follow uncommon patterns without making mistakes."", 'Remember, any state update of the consumer component and all its hooks will re-render the consumer and all its children. The only way to stop a re-render down the chain is to either use {children} in the JSX or to use memo() on a component or function. Anything else needs to execute the function/component to know if they should or not apply changes to the DOM. What you saved in the ""good"" example is the reference pointer to the values, you\'re not memoizing the execution of any code here, which kind of defeat the point of the memoization in your example.', 'But at the end of the day, it\'s not the end of the world.

Unit testing react components is a game of mock, hide and seek. Any table or chart with over 10000 nodes consumes so much memory that you need to add minimum memory requirements to your app. And this is without mentioning the insane amount of useMemo, useCallback and usePrayer you need to deploy to keep your app running without re-rendering because someone whispered they want to click on a white space in your app. React gives developers so many ways to shoot themselves in the foot that code reviews literally take 3 times longer just trying to make sure someone didn’t introduce a regression because added wrong useEffect dependency… Meanwhile updating dependencies is a no mans land because 1. Most third parties publish changes once a year and 2. Half of the react library is experimental features so you never know if suspense will resolve or you need to wait another 3 years until it becomes stable. And no the 3 years of development of React Compiler are not the promised land it was supposed to be, because it somehow (really didn’t think that’s possible) it results in even slower and higher memory app. Anyone who's build a React app for more than 100 domain objects immediately starts talking about micro frameworks, because this sh*t is unmanageable."", ""To understand the WHY, you have to go back to the beginning.

Learning programming concepts on my own and not having a degree in CS are constant concerns that come to mind. Starting to learn programming at 27, in addition to the aforementioned points, made me even more insecure.', 'By sharing all of this, I want to highlight another challenge that many juniors may encounter: shifting focus.', ""Now that I've overcome this mindset and found a bit of comfort and confidence in my path, I can see more clearly that I've wasted many days of my working hours being sad about the role I have and pondering a switch from front-end to back-end."", ""The lesson I've learned from this phase of my life is that by giving myself enough time and staying focused on my path, I can overcome my insecurities and find joy in my role again."", 'My message to new joiners: find what you love, stay focused, be patient.', ""Imposter syndrome is tough. 💙 This is another area where community is very important. I also don't have a CS degree and started learning to program at 28. I have learned that knowing about both front-end and back-end is a boon even if I'm in a role currently focused on front-end. A lot of this perspective came from talking to senior developers when I was a junior."", ""Yes, the community really helps. It's definitely important to learn both sides as a software engineer, in my opinion, and creating a T-shaped skillset would really help, sometimes being crucial. However, shifting career paths and putting much effort into a secondary field are what hold some individuals back, as I have experienced myself."", 'The you have links to community a beginner can join?', 'Thanks.', ""Sorry, unfortunately I haven't been really active in an online community untill now."", 'In the past, I relied on my circle of programmer friends who provided invaluable support. Over time, this circle grew, especially as I worked in various companies.', 'However platforms like here ( dev.to ) and freeCodeCamp forum can really help.', 'Also ADPList offers fantastic opportunities for mentorship and support.', ""I'm also a self-taught developer who begun at the age of 28. But I only learned front-end first because I was always told that as a self-taught developer, it was better to specialize first in something then doing the T-shaped skillset same as the software engineers."", 'And actually, it was the best advise I could get.', 'I specialized in vanilla CSS, then went deep in vanilla JS to make a deep dive in React. And my knowledge today, 5 years later, is good enough for having me teaching the software engineers how to use correctly React, setting the good practices and the base front-end technologies to use for the whole company and I was just offered to become the tech lead.', ""And this company is also giving my time during my job to learn back-end and devOps. I'm glad I focused on something to be very good at it instead of having tried different technologies, I wouldn't be where I am at today."", 'So my advice would be to maybe find what you like best front-end or back-end and focus on one of them first. Be (very) good on what you do and the sky will be the limit', 'And if that works for you, great! I and many other people have made a career out of being a wildcard person/generalist/full-stack developer. I\'ve always seen ""T-shaped experience"" used to remind career changers that their previous career taught them skills that apply to tech. Using it to describe the types of tools you know well is new to me.', ""Being very good at a few things came from solving whatever problems were thrown at me and going deep on what I was interested in. I respect the people who can be consistent and focused on one thing, but that's never been me. Some people learn best by focusing on a few tools while building a project. Others can sustain focusing on one tool, language, or type of problem for a while. Neither is better than the other or reserved for people with CS degrees. In fact, the tip about being able to turn ticket requirements is aimed at new CS grads as well as self-taught developers stuck in tutorial hell. 😉"", ""The important part is finding what type of learning works for you and what you need to sustain continuous building and learning. It's easy to beat ourselves up for wasting time or not making linear progress, but life happens and we still probably got useful experience (or rest) out of the detour."", ""Many of the best developers I know and a whole lot of the best developers in history didn't have a CS degree. I hate to see anyone feeling insecure or sad about common developer experiences. That's why I keep writing these kinds of posts and try to save space for people to share like @borzoomv has."", ""People have been assuming this blog is only for people with less experience than me. However, I've noticed a pattern in senior developers limiting themselves. Whether it's from a lack of community/perspective or a lack of confidence or both, it's easy to focus on the things we still struggle with, what we can't do yet, and where we are compared to others. It's a double-edged sword that we as developers have to know what we don't know. I'm proud of anyone who regularly practices the amount of learning, trying new things, and creativity it takes to build things with code. 💙"", ""Thank you, i'll definetely check these sites.\nI appreciate."", ""Thank you, i'll definetely check these sites.\nI appreciate."", ""Hi Borzoo, I agree with your thoughts. even I started programming when I didn't have a CS degree. it made me feel like doing coding without any vision. I worked on myself and read a lot of articles. I finally, enrolled for a CS degree while working in an IT company. I got my CS degree last year and I still feel like I should have enrolled in the past for regular instead of distance education."", ""I've left that feeling a way behind now, and now I have been working in IT for 8 years.

Thanks for sharing your advice and experience. I am still new to tech as a whole. I am in my 30s and my first degree is in Biology 😅. I discovered I loved computers but never had the chance to learn them back in high school plus I used to feel like it was a very complex field and too complicated for me to learn.', 'I am currently learning Full-Stack Web Development and am going to use your advice even as I am learning right now.', 'Once again thanks for sharing.', ""As a mid-level developer myself, I found these 12 tips incredibly valuable. It's always refreshing to hear advice from someone who's been through the trenches and knows what they're talking about. I especially appreciated tips 5 and 9 – they were exactly what I needed to hear right now. Keep up the great work, and please keep sharing your knowledge with us!"", 'I have been a dev for over 15 years and these are all great lessons to learn. #4 I particular really hit home to me.', ""For the vast majority of my career, people have been astonished that they can describe a problem to me and I can usually tell them where the problem is in my first guess. That's because I always make sure to have a deep understanding of how the entire system works."", ""And now I will share a tip from an architect that goes along with your first tip (sorta)... Influence is the name of the game. While level doesn't matter, what you do and how you show it matters a lot. If you are constantly proving that you know what you are talking about and build trust within your community, it is a lot easier to influence others to your way of thinking."", ""If you can't build that good will and have people respect your opinions, you are never going to get a promotion. As an example, I have been with the same company for most of my career. I was hired at the lowest level of dev and I now have coworkers who have been at the company longer, were 1 to 2 levels higher than me when I started, and now I am higher than them."", 'Your point 10 is very spot on in this respect. Having a support system that can guide you and push you helps a lot. It helps point out your weaknesses and how to address them. I would encourage everyone (especially jr devs) to find that experienced person (whether internal at your job or external like meet ups) to be a friend and mentor.', 'I am glad that proving you are technically competent has been enough at your company to garner influence and promotions.', ""For others, I recommend keeping a brag doc, so you know what to bring up at performance review time. For those who struggle with self-promotion, I recommend practicing stating your achievements, even if you have to do it so factually even your own brain can't argue. If you find there is no established goal post for promotion at your company or the goal post for your promotion moves as soon as you get near it, I recommend moving on to get the compensation you deserve."", 'I am also going to push back on', 'Having a support system that can guide you and push you helps a lot. It helps point out your weaknesses and how to address them.', 'Many of us get the challenge, pushing, and identifying weaknesses enough outside of our support network. It is totally fine to rely on your support network for only support. Mine has been instrumental in identifying which criticism is worth listening to and what kind of professional development environments will actually further my career/be healthy for me.', ""Many thanks for the great tips. Especially tip seven, as a beginner, I only recently realized how much time it takes to understand other people's code when you've spent most of your time learning to write code from scratch.""]"

But to test it now as a career option, I started making a game.

That curiosity, that need to understand how everything connects, is what separates people who just code from those who really love engineering.', 'The way you took the initiative to build tools at your company and naturally transitioned into a backend engineer role is proof that skill and effort eventually get noticed. It’s a great example of how taking ownership and solving real problems can open doors, even if you didn’t originally start in that field.', 'And yeah, backend can feel confining sometimes, but at the end of the day, an engineer is an engineer. The best ones don’t limit themselves to one role or stack; they just solve problems wherever needed.', 'You’ve built and launched real products, and that speaks louder than any degree. But like you said, there’s always more to learn. Whether it’s through bootcamps, books, or just making things, the key is to keep growing.', 'Unfortunately, though, we live in a world of perceptions. If you’re old, people think you resist change. If you’re Black and not quirky, they assume you don’t know tech. If you’re a woman, they question if you should manage.

Here is my musing (current thinking) which I\'m looking to confirm or correct: When the promise is instantiated it passes a two default callbacks to the executor, and runs the executor immediately (on the stack). A call to the first argument will have the Promise update it\'s state from ""pending"" to ""fulfilled"" and a call to the second will have it updated to ""rejected"". When the executor is finished (returns) it should have called one of these (or the promise will never resolve). After it has finished the instantiator returns and the promise is one of its three states. A call to .then() (optional) will register one or two callback handlers (for fulfilled and rejected). If the state of the promise is currently fulfilled or rejected it will immediately queues the appropriate callback onto the microtasks queue and return. If the state is pending, then the Promise itself will, as soon as its resolver or rejecter are called queue the appropriate callback then. I\'m not sure if that\'s entirely accurate and would love to see it documented as well as you have if it is, and or what is right if it\'s not.', ""When await is used, there is a situation I'm not clear on too. Await works a bit like yield I'm told, and it seems maintains the state of the running async function (on the heap one presumes) and as you write puts the async function on the microtask queue to continue at the same line (which the preserved state enables, though said state could be on the heap or on the microtask queue who knows?). In your example the function one resolves quickly, instantly, but if the function we are waiting on is still pending when the async function reaches the head of the microtask queue and runs once more, what then? I would guess it simply requeues itself.

I've been developing for almost 20 years and while I've never read this book, I have read other books that each contribute to my general understanding.

We have to be able to create, edit, delete and read basic information of users. Handling of sending authentication emails etc. is being done by the backend.

This has nothing to do with whether or not you can make a living through Fiverr but it is because people who know nothing about software development and web design pricing think that this work should be easy for us and thus should be paid cheaply. We as developers have to make a stand by not caving to low ballers simply because we may just need the money. Clients need to understand that good work requires plenty of time and a decent pay. Unfortunately, many devs outside of the US charge way too cheaply for these services, thus lowering expectations of pricing.', 'There’s another way to look at it: view Fiverr et al as acquisition channels. Having seen the “buying” side as well, the race to the bottom not only applies to prices but also quality, unfortunately. Whenever we contract someone from these platforms, we have to go through smaller projects since few people are willing to do an interview upfront. As Kyle pointed out, one small deal can lead to much bigger gigs and happy relationships and all you need to do is let quality shine through.', 'Exactly, Arne :) thanks for understanding it in context', 'I totally agree', 'Thanks for your opinion, Oziel :)', ""How much would you charge? (I would appreciate having examples including the position, language and experience if you could give)\nI haven't landed my first job yet."", ""Assuming you live in the US, it depends on the project. If it's a small static website (3 - 7 pages with no blog template), then the minimum I would charge is $500, especially if it's Wordpress; if you are a more experienced designer and can dish out a really good looking website, then you should be charging $800 - $1200, especially if there are a lot of unique pages (like landing pages) and if you are integrating a back end language for templating or for access to a database for storing a bit of data; high end websites could be $1400 to $2000. Then as you get in to the realm of e-commerce or large blogs, you have to start charging a minimum of $1000 but more like $1400 to $5000 depending on how big the business is (small shops would be in the lower range and large corporations would be charged that big price)."", ""Speaking of e-commerce, we should now mention web and mobile apps. If you are doing those types of projects, it's actually better to charge hourly because those projects can last 3 to 6 months, so you want to be compensated fairly for that. Junior devs would be charged $16 - $22/ hour, mid level would be like $24 - $30, and seniors would be $32 and above. In some projects, you could do a contract of a base fee like $1200 for a web app, plus an hourly rate for anything that's outside the scope of the work (think deployment, testing, making changes to work that's already been done, etc.)."", ""Of course these are my opinions on pricing so each developer's rates will differ. For the average stack of technologies like Python, JavaScript, PHP, the usual databases like MySQL or SQLite, you would refer to the rates I mentioned, but for more enterprise-level technologies like Java, .NET, SQL Server, you would charge a bit more.

So basically our work is done here but you know if we create any software then it also need maintainance and database management etc. and this will be forever till that software exists. Now our work was to just deliver the product or the software the client asked for but if the client asks how to manage it further or asks us only to also manage it for long then what should we do in these both cases? Even if we just explain the client everything needs to be done in order to manage that software, the client still does not have a proper knowledge of it and maybe he/she will not be able to manage it properly and if they'll not manage it, the software will automatically start to throw any bugs or errors and they'll blame us for that. Now if the other option occurs that the client wants us to take care of that software further also for the long run but obviously we can't do that. So how can we handle such situations? How will that software and its database will be managed throughout its lifecycle? And what exactly should we tell the client to do in such situations?

I usually have a rule of thumb of not charging up to 3 small improvements -- just so we can have a great partnership and the client usually will remember that good faith.

After all, those things were not prototyped nor planned, so, adding them at a later stage will impact your costs.', ""That's my usual way of dealing with maintenance and new requests of features disguised as maintenance."", ""In terms of database usage and infrastructure, I usually try to eyeball the usage/consumption of services by talking to the client and seeing their expectations -- if they are searching for a freelance to create a platform that will have to deal with thousands of customers, you can't put infrastructure costs on your end, but, if you're dealing with a small project, that might be viable."", ""And lastly, in terms of how to talk with your clients, it's important to remember that they are non-technical people usually, so, try to abstract most of the complexity when talking to them, showing only the high-level overview and the costs each part requires.

Here is my musing (current thinking) which I\'m looking to confirm or correct: When the promise is instantiated it passes a two default callbacks to the executor, and runs the executor immediately (on the stack). A call to the first argument will have the Promise update it\'s state from ""pending"" to ""fulfilled"" and a call to the second will have it updated to ""rejected"". When the executor is finished (returns) it should have called one of these (or the promise will never resolve). After it has finished the instantiator returns and the promise is one of its three states. A call to .then() (optional) will register one or two callback handlers (for fulfilled and rejected). If the state of the promise is currently fulfilled or rejected it will immediately queues the appropriate callback onto the microtasks queue and return. If the state is pending, then the Promise itself will, as soon as its resolver or rejecter are called queue the appropriate callback then. I\'m not sure if that\'s entirely accurate and would love to see it documented as well as you have if it is, and or what is right if it\'s not.', ""When await is used, there is a situation I'm not clear on too. Await works a bit like yield I'm told, and it seems maintains the state of the running async function (on the heap one presumes) and as you write puts the async function on the microtask queue to continue at the same line (which the preserved state enables, though said state could be on the heap or on the microtask queue who knows?). In your example the function one resolves quickly, instantly, but if the function we are waiting on is still pending when the async function reaches the head of the microtask queue and runs once more, what then? I would guess it simply requeues itself. But it would be great to know and to have whatever happens there, so excellently illustrated as you have."", 'I would be so thrilled if you lent you expert hand at illustrating answers to these.

So , if I shared Carbon as a resource, it would be with that heavy caveat but I'd probably not even list it as a very useful resource, because for that very very rare instance I do want that (like a header image here say) I can do a screen grab just fine in my Atom view of the code (my favourite editor), which already does beautiful code sensitive colouring and such."", 'Thanks a lot for the feedback 🙏❤']"

And of course by promoting, I mean they just put a few small links in the bottom of the video\'s description box and pin a comment to the top of the comment section. They don\'t use the YouTube systems which were made for promotion like Cards or End Screens; in fact the end screens just promote more FreeCodeCamp videos.', ""One of these Authors gave them 4 hours worth of content which is roughly 80% of his channel. The video was comprised of 60 short videos in a playlist on his channel. The video got roughly 60-70k views on FreeCodeCamp's YouTube channel but the Author didn't see any change in his subscriber base and his original content is now dead with maybe 1/20th of the viewership (and that is considering all 60 videos).

Any YouTube content creator knows that their content is basically free regardless of how many advertisements they put on their videos because a large portion of viewers use adblockers.', 'Frankly, this entire process is extremely shady and this is ignoring the potential copyright legality of re-posting content onto another channel.

You guys basically take the content that they make and create a way for that content to directly compete with the original channel. My friend and I did the research, we went through a large chunk of the guests you\'ve had on your channel since the beginning of the year. Very few of them have seen any kind of results from your promotion in terms of YouTube Subscribers or views. You talk about a bump in subscribers but I haven\'t seen anything of the sort after looking through the analytics. I won\'t name any names because I don\'t want to speak for anyone but there is very little cost efficiency for partnering with your channel.', 'Your company might be a not-for-profit company, but that isn\'t the case 99% of content creators. Most of them are developers and professionals who want provide education and make some money on the side. Many of them do the work because they find it interesting and fun but its also still work. Each video takes time and effort to create and giving away that work for ""Free"" to another company just isn\'t a good choice especially when that company could be doing so much more to pay back this donation via promotion.', ""To put things into perspective, it takes my friend roughly 4-5 hours to make ~20 minutes of video. This includes recording, editing, making a thumbnail, marketing, and setting up everything else. This doesn't include research which I would argue could almost double the time cost. If he was to give away 4 hours of his content; it would roughly equate to 48-60+ hours worth of work. If you do the math to make partnering with your channel worth while a channel would have to grow significantly and gain a fairly high click through rate (Which certainly isn't the case)."", 'For a recent example lets look at this video: ""Learn Data Science - Full Course for Beginners"" which was just released on the 30th. This video sits at about 36k views right now and it was created by a YouTube channel that has a total of 1.4k subscribers. On the day that the video was released, the channel received a total of 88 subscribers, the next day they received 36 subs and then the next day they received only 15 subscribers (falling back to its original average). Lets assume for a moment that all of those subscribers came from this video release (probably not the case); that\'s 139 subscribers in three days from a video that has 36k views - a 0.3% click through rate which is pathetic (for reference, 4-5% is the average you would expect on a normal YouTube Video). Most of the top comments on this video directly reference free code camp; they don\'t seem to have any idea that this was created by a user who isn\'t affiliated with your company. And why should they? nowhere in the video does it show that this video was created by the 3rd party author. The first thing you see is a big logo for FreeCodeCamp.', ""This video is a 5 hour video by the way, this author was very generous when he gave you the content. But where is your company's gratitude for this content creator? There are no cards promoting the channel, no end screen, no logo in the beginning of the video, no audible mention of the channel name, nothing except a small link in the description box (at the bottom mind you). And whats worse, you guys went and branded the video with your own brand. All I see are people talking about how great Free Code Camp is when in reality you are just taking content that other people made and not giving them proper compensation."", ""This is really shitty. I think I am going to go and contact your CEO directly because this is seriously worse then I thought it was. You guys are like a cancer that potentially destroys many budding content creators.

I make no call to actions, I don't show people my platform, people consume my content, they get to know me and find me afterwards. Is it in the magnitude of the number of views on the original video? No. But it is still in the thousands."", ""I'm just one person"", 'Exactly', ""I have not yet published anything on Medium, but had been interested in the FreeCodeCamp publication as a way to broaden my reach.

This command creates a directory for the component, 1-3 files according to the configuration (e.g. main component file, styles file and an index entrypoint) with the needed boilerplate, and optionally also opens them in your IDE.

You occasionally had to reboot the boxes, but deep troubleshooting wasn\'t generally necessary. More importantly, these sites\' owners paid their bills on time every time. Reliable income-stream. Then, Digex got new leadership tasked with growing the company. That leadership wanted to chase the business of the companies that eventually became the dot-com bust. Part of that was getting rid of all that ""disreputable"" adult site-hosting. In exchange, we got high-maintenance customers who demanded root ...and demanded credits for being offline when they used that privileged access to utterly bork their systems. Went from lots of generic builds to lots of special snowflakes. Ultimately, went to lots of consistently-paying customers to customers that ran up tens of thousands of dollar bills per month ...that frequently never paid (even though sales had already booked that billing and paid out commissions, bonuses, etc).

Legal, but not always fully ethical or moral, in my book. And here\'s why I think this way: You ask your rank and file to believe in you, believe in your brand, and give it their 110% every day. You do everything necessary to pump up the valuation of your company, both to make it attractive to investors and to ramp up what you can ask for it. Once the sale is made, all of the ""believe in the brand"" BS is gone from your mind, as are your employees you leave behind (who still do believe in the brand).', 'You care so little about them that you do not take the time/bargaining position to write into the contract of the sale some protections for them from the new ownership, such as business operations will continue as they are for at least six months, to give people some time to find other employment at comparable level/salary. Very few business owners share in the largesse received from the sale of a software/internet company in the form of a bonus or profit share, unless that employee is also an investor in their publicly traded company because, as always, shareholders are the only people who matter in this world.', ""It's time for me to step back down off of my virtual soapbox here in a comment chain on a post that is tangentially related in subject matter at best.

When done poorly, whether in concept or execution, they die a natural death in the business world, and their passing often goes unmourned. But when they are performing, and do provide the aforementioned services for us, especially when they do it for free or a very nominal fee, to see them be killed off suddenly due to a much larger competitor's ability to just purchase their smaller competitor outright seems to me to be unfair, and in some undefinable way slimy and shady."", 'Thank you for taking the time to read this.', ""While I'm not familiar enough with the business details of Delicious, I don't disagree with much of what you said in the general case."", ""Automattic is retaining the Tumblr staff so let's see how it goes from there."", 'Yahoo made many of the same mistakes when it bought Flickr which used to be the premier photo-sharing site.

You could load the current state from another canonical source (eg. from a REST endpoint, a database or a replica). Alternatively, you could periodically checkpoint or back up the state to a persistent store, and just replay events from the last checkpoint time to catch up.

Among many great advices they give, one is that we should always build things that don’t scale. They mean it for both business and tech parts. They advocate building “ugly” interfaces and non-scalable systems, just so we can have something up and running very fast, so we can validate early. I agree to some extent. When you really have no clue on whether your startup is going to work or not, then, yes, by all means, do things in a hacky way. But when uou have a bit of validations, some insights and a few early adopters like I did when I started, then no, don’t hack your way through. Make it scalable from the get-go. I like it this way because 1. Even if your software is built in a hacky way but still still, it is rather difficult to scale it. Scaling from spaghetti to scalable systems and code is WAY HARDER than building something from 0. Having it built in a great scalable way from the start makes building things on top of it a breeze. And 2. No stress. If you get a bigger influx of users, you’re all set.', 'My approach is: instead of building a complex architecture and system which does 100 things but it’s hacky, better build a thing that does 2-3 things and they are absolutely killing it. My marketplace, for example. Account creation, authentication, service creating/adding, and payments, all work 100% with a system low coupled, scalable and robust. Granted, those are just the basic functionalitity but that’s the point. Depth vs breadth. Add a service, make it scalable and independent, teeeeeest it until it becomes obnoxious to do so and then you’re good for something else.', 'I understand what you are saying that’s why the first solution was naive.', 'By the time I made the second solution I already had a lot of users and revenue:)', 'Great insights @nevodavid !', 'Thank you so much ❤️', 'Nice article!

Citing the articel:"", 'According to Peter Thiel, monopoly is better for society. When a business has a monopoly (meaning it faces no significant competition in the market where it operates), it has the freedom to consider the welfare of its employees and the broader impact of its products and operations on society because profits are assured.', ""Let's be clear about where the profits come from, namely two things:"", ""I think it's a bad thing and there are so many examples of monopolies abusing their positions, it's not even funny. Basically, they have a free ticket to make as much profit as they want and screw with the competition because of their higher position."", ""At least Thiel concedes that [...some monopolies...] prospers at society’s expense. I personally think it's the default pattern."", 'However, Thiel contends that this can only happen in a static market. Vertical progress redefines markets and makes new resources available, so monopolies are always temporary. If you create a monopoly by inventing a revolutionary technology, your monopoly will only last until someone else invents a technology that eclipses it.', 'I think is flawed. A monopoly tends to be self sustaining. Their goal is maintaining their dominance in the market and they have the means to do so. If some promising ""challenger"" dares to come up, it\'ll be bought or destroyed.
